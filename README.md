<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# ðŸ“– Torre take home project - Front-End <a name="about-project"></a>

Built a page that lists the skills of any given user existing in the database. It allows one to click on any skill and show details related to that user, shows a list of related experiences from that user, and a list of people who have the same skill.

## Deliverables

- A link for us to test what you built.

  ## ðŸš€ Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>

  - [Live Demo Link](https://torre-wander.netlify.app/)
  - [Back-End deployment](https://torre-c2xf.onrender.com)

- A way for us to review your code through a control version system (for example, GitHub), where we can check your incremental progress. 
   - [Github repo front-end](https://github.com/wandergithub/torre-takehome-test)
   - [Github repo back-end](https://github.com/wandergithub/torre-takehome-backend)

- A paragraph answering this question: What else could you have done or improved if you had more time?
  - With more time I would:
    - Implement a better solution for users with the same skill feature. A solution with less code is possible with a better-elaborated query(join table) I can avoid using the less efficient loops I used.
    - Work on a good detailed design and styling. (Details like overflow, page scrolling, and sizes are some improvements). The details window/modal is something I would do differently.
    - Change brochure-like elements layout.


Is- Anything else youâ€™d like to share with us?
 
An important note: *Keep in mind the back-end is with a free deployment service. It may take 1-2 minutes to respond the first time you use the app*
